       overflow: visible | hidden | scroll | auto;
       The values have the following effect:
       ✦ visible—The content is not clipped, and is displayed outside of its bounding box, if necessary (as in Figure 23-10).
       ✦ hidden—If the content is larger than its container, the content will be clipped. The clipped portion will not be visible, and the user will have no way to access it.
       ✦ scroll—If the content is larger than its container, the user agent should contain the content within the container, but supply a mechanism for the user to access the rest of the content (usually through scroll bars). Figure 23-11 shows the same paragraph as in Figure 23-10, but with its overflow property set
       to scroll.
       ✦ auto—The handling of element contents is left up to the user agent. Overflows, if they happen, are handled by the user agent’s default overflow method.
